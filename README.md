This project is a basic weather application built as part of a JavaScript learning challenge. It fetches weather data from a public API, displays current weather conditions, and provides a 5-day forecast.

### Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* A code editor or IDE
* A web browser

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in your code editor.**
3. **Run `index.html` in a web browser.**

### Features
* Displays current weather conditions (temperature, weather description, city name)
* Searches for weather information by city name
* Provides a 5-day weather forecast
* Uses weather icons to represent weather conditions
* Basic styling and user interface

### Technologies Used
* HTML

* Public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

### Structure
The project is organized into the following files:
* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the app.
* `style.css`: Styles the app's appearance.
* `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for fetching weather data, updating the UI, and handling user interactions.

### API Key
To use this app, you'll need to replace the placeholder API key in the `script.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
